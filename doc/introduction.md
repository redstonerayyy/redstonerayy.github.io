## What is Templex?

Templex is an in-developement tool for generating static websites.
It converts markdown and styling (scss, nunjucks) to html.

You shouldn't. It's not stable yet. It also may not fit your usecase,
as I focus on what i personally need.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Redstonerayy/templex/
yarn install
yarn build
node dist/main.js build
